## Passwordless login
We don't like to remember passwords. Passwords are predicatable. This wallet provides an endpoint to authenticate users via email. When a you input an email to the `/auth/new-token` endpoint, a code will be sent to your email to verify. Once your verification is successfull, you are granted access. No need to remember or save passwords and someone has to gain access to your email account to have access to your funds.
